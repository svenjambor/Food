# Recipes
Heck, code tells a computer what to do in order to cook up something.  So why not use it to tell me (or any other lifeform, carbon-based or otherwise) how to cook something IRL?!  

So - here's a collection of a couple of recipes I use and I tend to lose track of. Cudos to Github for being less forgetful than I am. And less prone to go "where on earth did I put..????"

If the recipe is not in English the title will contain the language code of the language it's in.

Oh, yes, this thing might acually end up as an app. So I added some front matter to the .md files to make things searchable. Eventually. Or never. Whatever.
