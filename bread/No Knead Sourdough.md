# No Knead Bread (sourdough based)

Thrown together in 5 minutes and left to rise all night this is the perfect bread to have breakfast (or lunch) on.

## Ingredients

### Dough

- 500g (4 cups)	all-purpose [flour]
- 200-350g (8 - 12oz) [sourdough]
- 3-5g 	(1 tsp)	dried [yeast]
- 50g (3-4 tbsp) olive [oil]
- 15g (3 tsp) [salt]
- 1 tsp Italian spices (optional)

## Instructions

### Prep (in the evening)

Mix all in bowl and let sit in cool place overnight (8-10h)

### Bake (in the morning)

1. Pre-heat oven to 230C / 450F
2. Put Dutch oven (or similar) in oven while pre-heating so it gets hot as well
3. Put dough on (heavily) floured countertop and let rest while oven is heating up
4. Lighly grease Dutch oven when it's hot
5. Gently fold dough and put it in Dutch oven (best with 2 people b/c hands will het sticky when putting the dough and you don't want to mess up your mittens). Disturb the dough as little as possible to preserve air.
6. Bake - with **lid on** - for about 30 minutes
7. Remove lid and bake with **lid off** for another 15 minutes

### Notes

TRY to let it cool down before cutting it (better for moisture distribution) - or eat it real quick ;-)
